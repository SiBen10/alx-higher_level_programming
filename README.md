# ALX High Level programming


	°Starting my journey in high level programming which I know is going to be fun and much more demanding and different from my previous encounter, but with determination and persistence it's definitly going to be easy just like the low-level-journey.


# Welcome to the Python world


	°The first projects are more "C-oriented" - no tricks, no funky syntax - simple!



	°If you've already played with Python, don't worry, fun things will come.



	°You'll soon find that with Python (and the majority of higher level languages), there are ten different ways to do the same thing. Some tasks will expect only one implementation, while other tasks will have multiple possible implementations.



	°Like C, Python also has a linter / style guide like Betty, called PEP8, also now known as PyCode.
